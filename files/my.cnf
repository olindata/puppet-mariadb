# MariaDB database server configuration file.
#
# =================================================================
# Base configuration courtesy of Open Query (http://openquery.com/)
# For production use, case-specific preparation is still required.
# 2009-10-07
#
# This is *not* an optimised config, merely a more sane baseline:
# - binary and slow log enabled, with enhancements
# - InnoDB default (e.g., ACID out-of-the-box, same as on Windows)
# - strict mode (for proper input checks, same as on Windows)
# - various other useful settings
# - make use of MariaDB/Percona/OurDelta enhancements/extensions
#
# For tuning assistance, please see http://openquery.com/services
# =================================================================
#
# You can copy this file to one of:
# - "/etc/mysql/my.cnf" to set global options,
# - "~/.my.cnf" to set user-specific options.
# 
# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.
#
# For explanations see
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/server-system-variables.html

# This will be passed to all mysql clients
# It has been reported that passwords should be enclosed with ticks/quotes
# escpecially if they contain "#" chars...
# Remember to edit /etc/mysql/debian.cnf when changing the socket location.
